# IWMI - ITC Knowledge Partnership

***"IWMI – ITC Knowledge partnership"*** was formed to assist ITC’s Social Investments Program, “Mission Sunehra Kal”, which aims to address the vulnerabilities of agricultural communities, particularly with regard to water. The focus of the mission is on assisting communities to collectively conserve and manage local natural resources, broad-base farming systems and expand off-farm income portfolios to promote growth of rural economies. Community participation and multi-stakeholder partnerships are intrinsic to the model.  
To strengthen the impacts of field interventions and contribute to building the resilience of local communities, in 2018-19, ITC and IWMI formed a strategic knowledge partnership. As part of this partnership, IWMI developed conceptual and analytical framework for *‘Drought-proofing of ITC’s agri-catchments’* and for delivering *‘water security for all’* in ITC’s factory catchments and inturn scale upto larger watersheds across India and work in sync with mandates and activities with various government initiatives.

## Drought Proofing
Conceptual drought-proofing framework was further developed into a user-friendly “Drought proofing tool” that employs a monthly water balance approach embedded in a simple Microsoft Excel spreadsheet interface to map water supply and demand dynamics at the catchment level. Tool gives an idea what interventions to plan and what are the potential benefits, and in-turn prepare DPR (Helpful for field level NGO partners). 
The tool was applied in ITC’s drought prone agri-catchments in Karnataka (Mysore), Andhra Pradesh (Prakasam), Madhya Pradesh (Sehore) and Rajasthan (Jhalawar) and helped ITC’s state teams in designing interventions. Application of tool to watersheds shows the potential to carry out effective and scientific evidence-based planning for designing investments.

### Field Application of Drought tool
Drought proofing Tool is used by Karnataka Watershed department for actively planning interventions in 100 watersheds in 1.16 million acres of land in 29 districts in Karnataka. upscale and use by other NGOs and line department for watershed planning.

## Water Security for All
With the aim to deliver ‘water security for all’ for communities and all co-dependents living in close proximity to factory locations, conceptual risk-based framework for water security assessment was developed. As part of the Water security framework, definition of water security was defined since there is no consistent definition exists. Detailed guidelines for assessing each of the above has been developed. The Water Security framework was applied to ITC’s factory locations at Mureru, Ghod basin, Bengaluru/ Malur and Upper Bhavani sub-basin.

## Project Dissemination
Capacity building workshops and one to one sessions with ITC’s state teams and NGO partners was organized to disseminate drought framework/tool and water security framework. 
National level virtual workshop on “Drought Proofing Agriculture and Water Security in Catchments” was organized to present the drought proofing framework + tool and water security framework to practitioners, policy makers and professionals. The Workshop was attended by ~150 participants/experts from Central Water Commission (CWC), Central Groundwater Board (CGWB), National Rainfed Area Authority (NRAA), Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), NITI Aayog, NGOs, donors, private sector, research institutes. 
Experts/Participants showed keen interest on using the tool and framework. Policy recommendation was developed based on the discussions and feedbacks from experts.



## Way forward
As part of next phase: Support ITC and partners’ drought proofing and water security activities at watershed level and beyond to sub-basin scale through use of scientific and evidence-based tools for planning Develop a tool like drought proofing for Unit water security planning which can be used by ITC and its NGO teams. Improving and expanding the capabilities of developed drought proofing tool and framework. Train ITC directly and through them their NGOs (across India) on both drought proofing & unit water security - concept, framework and tools and provide handholding support to adopt the frameworks across all operational catchments decided by ITC.
